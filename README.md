# Nucamp React Portfolio Project

I initially wanted to continue my Bootstrap (Lefty Records) project but realized that it was a bigger task to tackle. I researched and watched a bunch of tutorials on Sanity and decided to work on a portfolio website using React, Sass, and Sanity.

Once I complete the Nucamp Bootcamp, I should have a better grasp of development and I'll continue buidling my Lefty Records web/mobile application.
